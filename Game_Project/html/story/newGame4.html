            The village chief further explains that the wizard Morgath originally obtained great power by entering through the Veil of Realms.
            To stand against Morgath one must also enter the Veil and discover their true potential.
            However, fearing that one day someone may threaten his overwhelming power, Morgath locked the Veil away with three magical keys.
            The wizard Morgath then hid these three keys and safeguards them to this day.
            
            Finnian Drake must now seek these keys and save his village!
